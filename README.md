# aws-samples

These sample AWS Lambda functions are used to manage files stored in AWS S3.

Each function is meant to be behind an API Gateway with specific HTTP verbs.

These functions can be used "as-is", however, it is best to use it as a starting point and implement your own functions.

# uploadFile.js
This function receives file data from a POST request, along with a ```filesize``` & ```filetype``` query parameter. It then creates a ```presignedPost``` request with an autogenerated filename and specific S3 bucket. The resulting ```filename```, ```fileSize``` & ```fileType``` is saved to the database. The results from the presigned request are then returned to the client.

# listFile.js
This function returns a list of all the files saved in the database, sorted by the date created via a GET request.

# getFile.js
This function returns a ```signedURL``` and ```filename``` from the specified ```key``` query parameter from a GET request. Using the ```key```, it gets the stored information from the database. If there is a key with that name, it then creates a ```SignedURL``` request from S3 and returns the data to the client.

# deleteFile.js
This function takes a ```key``` query parameter and deletes both, the entry int the database and the object from S3.
